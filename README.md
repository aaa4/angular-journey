# Examples

This is my journey to angular word. 

## Angular version
Works fine at v 9

## Parts

MatTable with sorting ets, using custom paginated interface for java   Paginated json-responce.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
